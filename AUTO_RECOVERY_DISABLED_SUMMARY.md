# Auto-Recovery Feature Disabled - Summary

## Problem Solved
The auto-recovery feature was running every minute and showing console errors:
```
Auto-recovery failed: "Comprehensive recovery: 0 fixed, 0 retried"
```

Since all media has been successfully added and the system is stable for exhibition, this background process was no longer needed and was causing unnecessary console noise.

## Changes Made

### 1. entity/src/app/exhibit/page.tsx
- **Line 6**: Commented out import: `// import { useAutoErrorRecovery } from '@/hooks/useAutoErrorRecovery';`
- **Lines 20-24**: Disabled the useAutoErrorRecovery hook call:
```typescript
// Auto error recovery disabled - no longer needed for exhibition
// useAutoErrorRecovery({
//   enabled: false,
//   interval: 60000, // Check every minute for exhibit
// });
```

### 2. entity/src/app/gallery/page.tsx
- **Line 7**: Commented out import: `// import { useAutoErrorRecovery } from '@/hooks/useAutoErrorRecovery';`
- **Lines 70-88**: Disabled the useAutoErrorRecovery hook call and all related logic
- **Line 305**: Commented out the manual recovery call in refreshAllSpecies function

## Expected Results
✅ **Console errors about auto-recovery will stop**
✅ **System will be cleaner for exhibition use**
✅ **No background processes trying to fix non-existent errors**
✅ **Better performance during exhibition**
✅ **Reduced unnecessary API calls**

## System Status
- **Media Upload System**: ✅ Working (manual upload workflow established)
- **Gallery Interface**: ✅ Working (version navigation functional)
- **Exhibit Mode**: ✅ Working (mobile-first display ready)
- **Real-time Updates**: ✅ Working (SSE notifications still active)
- **Auto-recovery**: ❌ Disabled (no longer needed)

## Files Preserved
The auto-recovery system files remain intact for future use if needed:
- `entity/src/hooks/useAutoErrorRecovery.ts`
- `entity/src/app/api/admin/auto-error-recovery/route.ts`
- `entity/src/lib/error-recovery.ts`

## Next Steps for Exhibition
The system is now optimized for exhibition use with:
1. All media successfully uploaded and accessible
2. Clean console output without error recovery noise
3. Stable gallery and exhibit interfaces
4. Manual media upload workflow documented
5. Species list cleaned up (duplicates removed)

The exhibition is ready to run without background interference from the auto-recovery system.
