# 🚀 FINAL STEPS: Deploy Your Entity v1.0 App to GitHub Pages

Your Next.js project is fully configured for GitHub Pages! The authentication issue prevents pushing the workflow file, but you can easily create it manually on GitHub.

## ✅ What's Already Done
- ✅ Next.js configured for static export
- ✅ API routes removed (GitHub Pages compatible)
- ✅ Client-side navigation implemented
- ✅ All code changes pushed to GitHub

## 🎯 Final Step: Create the Workflow File

**Go to your GitHub repository and create the workflow file manually:**

1. **Navigate to**: https://github.com/wuchinow/entity
2. **Click**: "Actions" tab
3. **Click**: "New workflow" 
4. **Click**: "set up a workflow yourself"
5. **Replace** the default content with this exact code:

```yaml
name: Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
        
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

6. **Name the file**: `deploy.yml`
7. **Click**: "Commit changes..."
8. **Click**: "Commit changes" (confirm)

## 🎉 Expected Result

Within 5-10 minutes after creating the workflow:

- Your site at **https://wuchinow.github.io/entity/** will show the full Entity v1.0 application
- Dark themed interface with "Entity" branding
- Interactive landing page with navigation
- Gallery, admin, and other app pages working

**No more documentation page - your actual app will be live!**

## 🔍 Monitor Progress

- Go to **Actions** tab to watch the deployment progress
- Once the workflow completes successfully, your app will be live
- The workflow will run automatically on every future push to main branch

Your Entity v1.0 application is ready to go live! 🚀
