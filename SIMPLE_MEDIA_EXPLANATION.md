# How Media Display Works - Simple Explanation

## The Big Picture
Think of your system like a **photo album with an index card system**:

1. **Storage** = Your photo album (where actual photos are kept)
2. **Database** = Index cards that tell you what photos exist and where to find them
3. **Gallery** = The display that reads the index cards to show photos

## What is SQL?
**SQL** = "Structured Query Language" 
- It's like writing instructions to organize your index cards
- Think of it as commands like "Find all photos of dogs" or "Add a new photo card"
- You write these commands in a special format that the database understands

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Upload File to Storage âœ… (You did this!)
- You put `acacia_acanthoclada_1.png` in the photo album
- It's physically stored in Supabase Storage
- But the gallery doesn't know it exists yet!

### Step 2: Create an Index Card (Database Entry)
- The gallery only shows photos that have index cards
- We need to create an index card that says:
  - "There's an Acacia photo"
  - "It's located at this specific address"
  - "It belongs to this species"
  - "It's version 2" (or whatever number)

### Step 3: How the Gallery Works
When you click on a species in the gallery:
1. Gallery asks database: "Show me all index cards for Acacia"
2. Database returns: "Here are 2 cards - version 1 and version 2"
3. Gallery displays both photos with navigation between them

## Why Files Must Be Linked to Database
- **Storage alone** = Photos in a box with no labels
- **Database alone** = Index cards pointing to missing photos
- **Both together** = Organized photo album that works

## The SQL Command We Need
This is like writing an index card:

```sql
INSERT INTO species_media (...)
```

Translation: "Create a new index card with this information..."

## Let's Do This Together

### First, let's see what's currently in your gallery:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/gallery
2. Click on "Acacia acanthoclada" (first species)
3. Tell me: Do you see any photos, or does it say "No media generated yet"?

### Then we'll add your photo:
1. I'll help you write the SQL command (index card)
2. You'll paste it into Supabase
3. Your photo will appear in the gallery!

## What You Need to Tell Me:
1. **What do you see** when you click Acacia in the gallery?
2. **Your Supabase project URL** (I'll help you find this)

Then I can create the exact command for you!
