# Gallery Presentation Mode - Locked Configuration

## Overview
The gallery interface has been converted to presentation mode with locked media selections and improved aspect ratio preservation for exhibition display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Controls Removed
- **Media Type Selection Thumbnails**: Removed image/video selection buttons at bottom
- **Version Navigation**: Removed arrow controls and version counters
- **Media Switching**: Interface now automatically displays the best available media for each species

### 2. Media Selection Logic Updated
- **Curated Content**: Now uses first available media (remaining after curation via 'x' button)
- **Locked Selections**: No user controls to change between media versions
- **Automatic Display**: System automatically selects image or video based on availability
- **Presentation Ready**: Each species shows only the curator-approved media

### 3. Aspect Ratio Preservation Fixed
- **Image Display**: Enhanced CSS properties to prevent cropping/stretching
  - Added `width: 'auto'` and `height: 'auto'`
  - Maintained `objectFit: 'contain'` for proper scaling
  - Added `display: 'block'` for better rendering
- **Video Display**: Same aspect ratio improvements applied
- **Container Adjustments**: Increased padding and adjusted height calculations
- **Responsive Behavior**: Media maintains proper proportions across window sizes

### 4. Exhibition Interface Cleanup
- **Hide Buttons Removed**: No more 'x' buttons on media (curation complete)
- **Technical Controls Removed**: All version management UI eliminated
- **Clean Display**: Focus entirely on content presentation
- **Visitor-Friendly**: No confusing technical elements
