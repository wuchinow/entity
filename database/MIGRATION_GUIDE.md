# Database Migration Guide - Entity v1.0

## Overview
This guide explains how to update your live Supabase database to include the storage columns needed for media persistence.

## Current Issue
The application is getting "supabase_video_path column not found" errors because the live database is missing the storage columns that were added to the schema.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script
1. Copy the entire contents of `entity/database/migration_add_storage_columns.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Step 3: Verify Migration Success
The migration script includes verification queries that will show:
- All the new columns that were added
- Current species count and generation status distribution

Expected output should show these columns exist:
- `supabase_image_path`
- `supabase_video_path` 
- `supabase_image_url`
- `supabase_video_url`
- `image_generated_at`
- `video_generated_at`
- `generation_status`

### Step 4: Test the Application
After running the migration:
1. Refresh your Entity v1.0 application
2. Try generating a new species (image + video)
3. Check that the media files are properly stored and displayed
4. Verify the admin panel shows correct storage statistics

## What This Migration Does

### Adds Storage Columns
- **supabase_image_path**: File path in Supabase Storage bucket
- **supabase_video_path**: File path in Supabase Storage bucket  
- **supabase_image_url**: Public URL for the stored image
- **supabase_video_url**: Public URL for the stored video

### Adds Generation Tracking
- **image_generated_at**: Timestamp when image was generated
- **video_generated_at**: Timestamp when video was generated
- **generation_status**: Current status of the generation process

### Creates Indexes
- Improves query performance for the new columns
- Optimizes admin panel and gallery queries

### Updates Existing Data
- Sets `generation_status = 'pending'` for any existing species
- Preserves all existing species data

## Safety Features
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if columns already exist
- Preserves all existing data
- Includes verification queries to confirm success
- Can be run multiple times safely

## Rollback (if needed)
If you need to rollback this migration:

```sql
-- Remove the added columns (WARNING: This will delete stored file paths)
ALTER TABLE species 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS supabase_image_path,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS supabase_video_path,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS supabase_image_url,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS supabase_video_url,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS image_generated_at,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS video_generated_at;

-- Remove generation_status column and constraint
ALTER TABLE species DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS species_generation_status_check;
ALTER TABLE species DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS generation_status;

-- Remove indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_species_generation_status;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_species_supabase_image_path;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_species_supabase_video_path;
```

## Post-Migration Benefits
After this migration:
- âœ… Media files will persist permanently in Supabase Storage
- âœ… No more disappearing images/videos from temporary Replicate URLs
- âœ… Admin panel will show accurate storage statistics
- âœ… Gallery will load faster with cached media
- âœ… Application ready for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. Check the error message in the SQL Editor
2. Ensure you have proper permissions (service_role access)
3. Verify the species table exists in your database

### If Columns Already Exist
The migration script is safe to run even if some columns exist. It will skip existing columns and only add missing ones.

### If Application Still Shows Errors
1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
4. Verify the migration completed by running the verification queries

## Next Steps After Migration
1. âœ… Database schema updated
2. ðŸ”„ Configure Vercel deployment 
3. ðŸ”„ Add species loop automation
4. ðŸ”„ Update Replicate API keys for production
5. ðŸ”„ Set up monitoring and error handling
