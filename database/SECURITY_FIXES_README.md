# Supabase Security Fixes

This document explains the security issues identified by Supabase Security Advisor and the fixes applied to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Security Definer View (admin_dashboard)
**Issue**: The `admin_dashboard` view was created with `SECURITY DEFINER` (default), which means it runs with the privileges of the view creator rather than the user executing the query. This can bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Risk**: Users might access data they shouldn't have permission to see, potentially bypassing RLS restrictions.

**Fix**: Changed the view to use `SECURITY INVOKER` by adding `WITH (security_invoker = on)` to ensure it respects the current user's permissions and RLS policies.

### 2. Function Search Path Mutable
**Issue**: Three functions had mutable search paths:
- `update_updated_at_column()`
- `get_generation_stats()`
- `reset_generation_status()`

**Risk**: Functions without fixed search paths can be vulnerable to search path attacks where malicious users could create objects in schemas that appear earlier in the search path, potentially hijacking function calls.

**Fix**: Added `SET search_path = public` to all functions to fix the search path and prevent search path injection attacks.

## Files Created

### 1. `security_fixes.sql`
Complete migration script that:
- Recreates the `admin_dashboard` view with `SECURITY INVOKER`
- Updates all functions with proper `SET search_path = public`
- Adds additional secure helper functions
- Includes verification queries

### 2. `verify_security_fixes.sql`
Comprehensive verification script that:
- Checks view security settings
- Verifies function search path configurations
- Tests function functionality
- Reviews RLS policies and status
- Provides a security summary report

### 3. Updated `schema.sql`
The main schema file has been updated to include all security fixes for future deployments.

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Apply to Existing Database
Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of security_fixes.sql
```

### Option 2: Fresh Database Setup
Use the updated `schema.sql` file which includes all security fixes.

## Verification

After applying the fixes, run the verification script:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of verify_security_fixes.sql
```

Expected results:
- ✅ All functions should show "search_path configured"
- ✅ admin_dashboard view should show "SECURITY INVOKER enabled"
- ✅ All functions should work correctly
- ✅ Overall status should be "ALL SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED"

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. View Security
- **SECURITY INVOKER**: Views now respect the current user's permissions
- **RLS Enforcement**: Row Level Security policies are properly enforced

### 2. Function Security
- **Fixed Search Path**: All functions use `SET search_path = public`
- **SECURITY DEFINER**: Functions maintain elevated privileges where needed
- **Input Validation**: Functions include proper parameter handling

### 3. Additional Security Functions
- `update_species_generation_status()`: Safe species updates with proper validation
- `get_admin_dashboard_data()`: Secure function alternative to the view

## Impact on Application

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- Database queries remain functional
- RLS policies are preserved

### Enhanced Security
- Search path injection attacks prevented
- RLS policies properly enforced
- Privilege escalation risks mitigated

## Monitoring

After applying these fixes, the Supabase Security Advisor should show:
- ❌ → ✅ Security Definer View: RESOLVED
- ❌ → ✅ Function Search Path Mutable: RESOLVED

## Quick Reference

### Files to Run in Order:
1. `security_fixes.sql` - Apply all security fixes
2. `verify_security_fixes.sql` - Verify fixes were applied correctly

### Key Changes Made:
- `admin_dashboard` view: Added `WITH (security_invoker = on)`
- `update_updated_at_column()`: Added `SET search_path = public`
- `get_generation_stats()`: Added `SET search_path = public`
- `reset_generation_status()`: Added `SET search_path = public`

### Security Status:
- ✅ Search path injection attacks: PREVENTED
- ✅ RLS bypass via views: PREVENTED
- ✅ Privilege escalation: CONTROLLED
- ✅ All functions: SECURE

## Support

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:
1. Run the verification script to identify specific problems
2. Check that all functions return expected results
3. Verify RLS policies are still working as expected
4. Ensure application functionality remains intact
